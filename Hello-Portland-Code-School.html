            I haven't learned how to do too much with html yet, but I can do fun font changes like make text 
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>bold</strong></li>
                <li><em>italic</em></li> 
                <li>and <u>underlined</u>.</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <p>
            I can also do fun things like turn a picture of a cute cat a stealthy link. Try it out!:

            "Where does this picture lead to?" the cat ponders, peering at it inquisitively. Well, where does your curiosity lead you?

            I am looking forward to learning how to do a lot more with web development, and can't wait to join the Full Stack JavaScript course at PCS! Thanks!
